# windy-grid-world-in-reinforcement-learning

Windy Gridworld is a standard gridworld with start and goal states. The difference is that there is a crosswind running upward through the middle of the grid. Actions are the standard four: up, right, down, and left. In the middle region the resultant next states are shifted upward by the "wind" which strength varies from column to column. The reward is -1 until goal state is reached.
